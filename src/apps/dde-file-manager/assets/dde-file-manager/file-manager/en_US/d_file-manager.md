### Add a Single Corner Marker

1. Open Terminal, input **gio set xxx(file path)  -t stringv metadata::emblems "xxx(icon path)"**, which means to add a corner marker in the lower right corner of the file/folder icon by default.

> ![attention](../common/attention.svg) Attention: the special corner markers defined by the system could not be replaced.

2. You can add position codes into the above command to add a corner marker to the upper left corner(lu), lower left corner(ld), upper right corner(ru) or lower right corner(rd).
   For example, to add a corner marker to the upper left corner, you have to input:
   **gio set xxx(file path)  -t stringv metadata::emblems "xxx(icon path);lu"**

### Add Multiple Corner Markers

To add 2~4 corner markers to a file/folder, you can input "|" in the command to separate multiple paths of the corner marker files. Only one corner marker can be added to the same corner, but you can replace it.

For example, to add 4 corner markers to a file/folder icon, you can input:
**gio set xxx(file path)  -t stringv metadata::emblems "xxx(icon path);lu|xxx(icon path);ld|xxx(icon path);ru|xxx(icon path);rd"**
